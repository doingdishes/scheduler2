simple scheduler that requires just a little bit of TLC once it is in the workbook.

to operate properly, ensure the directory already has a file named "Book1.xlsx"
(or whatever you want to save to, will just require modifying the script)

running the script WILL overwrite the previous file unless you change the save name.

to copy to column view:
    select row -> copy values -> paste to column special + transpose
